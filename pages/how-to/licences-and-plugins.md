# List of components and licenses

We have used these items in our work. As far as we are aware, where there are licensing requirements, they are permissive and not unduly restrictive, so are suitable for our purposes (for example, the MIT license).

| Item | Link | License | Comments |
|------|------|----------|
| Tom Johnson's theme | [Tom Johnson's theme license][Tom Johnson's theme license] | MIT | Tom Johnson's theme. We are not using this directly but have drawn very heavily on hist expertise and examples, so it is only fair to credit his effort even if we don't explicitly need to do so. |
| Bootstrap | [Bootstrap license][Bootstrap license] | MIT | Used for some of the styling. |


[Tom Johnson's theme license]: https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/documentation-theme-jekyll/blob/gh-pages/licenses/LICENSE
[Bootstrap license]: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/LICENSE
