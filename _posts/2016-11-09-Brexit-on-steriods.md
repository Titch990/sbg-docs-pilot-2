# level 1 heading

Well. Here's my test blog.

Everything we do in the UK, the USA does bigger and better and more brashly and more arrogantly.

The only good thing about today is that this blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

## Some markdown stuff

This is a code block (these are back quotes)

```
a = b;
c = c;
```

This sentence has code characters in it ```here```. But then we continue in ordinary text.

Here's a table:

|head1|head2|head3|
|-------|-----|------|
|row 1 cell 1|row 1 cell 2|row 1 cell 3|
|row 2 cell 1 and long, long, long, long text in this cell because I can. What about a second row in the cell?|row 2 cell 2|row 2 cell 3|
|row 3 cell 1|row 3 cell 2|row 3 cell 3|
|row 4 cell 1|row 4 cell 2|row 4 cell 3|
|row 5 cell 1|row 5 cell 2|row 5 cell 3 with some very long text|

This will be a code char ```codechar``` followed by ordinary text.

## trying a simple variable (declared in this post)

This is the documentation for {{ page.product-name }}.

Use ```page.<variable>``` for variables set on the same page. That's not what I want eventually, still.

## and a simple snippet

The remaining content in this section is an included snippet.

{% include /MJ-snippets/test-snippet1.md %}

## and a simple condition
